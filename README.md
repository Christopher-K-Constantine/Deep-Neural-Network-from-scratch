# L_layered-Deep-Neural-Network-Implementation
  This notebook includes implementation of the DNN with L-layered architecture with a sample dataset from scikit-learn datasets. You can use this notebook as a L-layered DNN model to train different datasets and different architectures. You have to fit train dataset of shape (dimensions, examples) and target output set of (dimensions,examples) to the model and parameters will be resulted. Hyperparameters are also there to tune as your preferrence and predictions can be made.
